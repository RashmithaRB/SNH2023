            <h1>Sprinkler Irrigation </h1>
            <p><span>Sprinkler Irrigation</span>is a method of irrigation in which water is sprayed, or sprinkled through the air in rain like drops. The spray and sprinkling devices can be permanently set in place (solid set), temporarily set and then moved after a given amount of water has been applied

            <p><span>Surface Irrigation</span>consists of a broad class of irrigation methods in which water is distributed over the soil surface by gravity flow.Surface irrigation is best suited to flat land slopes, and medium to fine textured soil types which promote the lateral spread of water down the furrow row or across the basin.

            <h1>Drip Irrigation</h1>
            <p><span>Drip Irrigation</span>systems are methods of microirrigation wherein water is applied through emitters to the soil surface as drops or small streams. The discharge rate of the emitters is low so this irrigation method can be used on all soil types.</p>
